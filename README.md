# Python

This is my collection of python labs and personal projects that I have completed throughout the years. Shamelessly copy whatever you want!  

# Installation 

Depending on which one of my files you wish to run, you must have either Python 2 or 3 installed on your machine. To install python / idle onto your machine you can do the following.

Windows:

       Navigate to Python website
       
       Python(https://www.python.org/downloads/)
       
       Select version desired
       
       Follow GUI instructions
       
       Browse to the directory where it was installed.

       Right-click in the empty space, choose New -> Text Document, name it idle.bat (accept the warning about file         
       extensions).
      
       Edit the file by right-clicking and choosing Edit.

       Enter the single line:
      
       $ C:\Python27\Lib\idlelib\idle.bat
       
Mac:
       
       Navigate to Python website
       
       Python(https://www.python.org/downloads/)

       Follow GUI instructions
       
       Browse to your installed directory.
